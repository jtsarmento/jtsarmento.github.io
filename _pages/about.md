I have spent a majority of my life playing organized sports.  Most notably playing water polo for University of the Pacific.   While there, I prided myself on being able to balance school,  practice, weight training and traveling.  Those experiences have helped me understand that communication, competitiveness, coachability, leadership and teamwork are crucial to the success of any team. I strive to bring those to the work place I am in today.
